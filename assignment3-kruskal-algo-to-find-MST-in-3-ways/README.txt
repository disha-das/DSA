This executable implements the krushkal algo to find MST in 3 ways/modes:
mode1: name array
mode2: parent array
mode3: parent array with weighted merge

The executable will first prompt for required graph details as input.

Based on the mode input by user, the MST for the graph will be printed.

The init, find and union operations of the three modes are implemented as pluggable code in the krushkal procedure.
